# Membership_app
This Python program collects information about athletes and calculates the costs of their training, coaching, and competitions. The program repeatedly asks the user to enter details such as the athlete's name, gender, grade (Beginner, Intermediate, Elite), current weight, competition weight category, number of competitions entered, and private coaching hours. Based on the athlete's grade, it assigns a training cost, calculates coaching costs depending on the hours, and adds competition fees for Intermediate and Elite athletes. It also checks if the athlete's weight is within the limit for their weight category. The program then stores all this information in a dictionary for each athlete and adds it to a list of athletes. Finally, it displays a summary of the costs and weight comparison for each athlete. The program uses Python features like input() for user input, float() and int() for number conversion, if-elif-else statements for decision making, dictionaries to store athlete data, lists to store multiple athletes, and while loops to allow entering multiple athletes until the user chooses to stop.
This is one of my first ever python projects.
